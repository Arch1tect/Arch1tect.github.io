title: A Weekend with Little Accomplishment
---

A weekend with little accomplishment, spent so many hours trying to ajaxify the comment system of my blog. In the end, I almost succeed with Jan’s *WP-Ajaxify-Comments*, except if people want to reply to another visitor’s comment, the page still refreshes. But that’s it, I have to work on my assignments. Maybe Jan will give me a hand on this tomorrow or I’ll have to wait until I myself become good enough in ajax, we’ll see.

To me ajax is so going to play a huge role in the web soon, I guess it’s already playing. I find it inevitable since people are spending more and more time on the Internet, TV shows, movies, books and apps are all gradually moved online. Refreshing the whole page interrupts the video you are watching, the music you are playing, anyway, waste your time. In a word, it’s the technology that’s needed. And in that sense, I should definitely learn it whether Jan helps me fix it or not. Also, the next generation of WordPress should be all ajaxified in my opinion.

Talking about playing music on the web, I came across a website called “playlist” yesterday, which seems a lot better than *Pandora*, but I’m quite curious about how they deal with the copyright issue. Below is Avril’s *Innocence* from that website:

</center>Someone asked me about how to play music in the background of his WordPress blog, since he can’t find a plugin that doesn’t show the music player. Failed in convincing him that it’s already a bad idea to play music automatically, not to mention hiding the player so visitors can’t even turn it off, leaving them the only option – close the website and never come again, I tried to hack a plugin, adding a “hide the player” option to it. But then I found a tiny piece of code that is good enough to solve his problem instead of using a plugin. 

`<embed autostart="true" height="0" loop="true" src="music url (playlist.com works here)" width="0"/>`

Just put it in header.php of the theme that you are using.

Despite my frustration with ajax, I did manage to do a tiny little tweak of my guestbook widget with css, making the front page a little more minimal with less color. I certainly should design and code my own theme someday, but clearly won’t in near future.

Also watched a Japanese movie on Sunday night - *Suspect X*, again it raise the question of whether we should always be faith to truth, it’s a big and interesting topic, but it’s way past sleep time already..

So… good night, anyone who reads this.
