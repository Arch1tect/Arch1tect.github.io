title: DMSGuestbook and Gravatar
---

I’m using  Daniel Schurter’s DMSGuestbook plugin but to me it’s not very convenient because visitors need to type two emails or the same email twice. It’s not a bug since Daniel has his [reason](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/gravatars-in-dmsguestbook?replies=4) for it.

Anyway, neither most of my visitors nor me like that, but I’m too lazy to read through the codes to hack it myself. – -|||

Since it’s nothing urgent so I just post what I want to accomplish at wordpress.org hoping for some instruction. To my greatest surprise, only about half an hour later, Daniel himself replied me and he actually did the code for me, passing me a link to the hacked file! That’s way beyond my expectation! So this post is both to share that hacked file and to express my gratitude to him, thank you Daniel. ^ ^

And that’s why I love WordPress!
