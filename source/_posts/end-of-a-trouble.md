title: End of a Trouble
---

A big trouble that’s been bothering/torturing me for months has finally ended. The result is better than my expectation. I need to remember this setback and learn my lesson. And I should always be grateful for my life. If there exists a higher power, I’m thankful to it. 

The future is much brighter and clearer now but my plan for next semester remains unclear. Now I just need one elective course with ‘Data Structure’ to get my minor degree but the policy forbade taking them together. That means another semester is needed for this left alone elective though I have only two must-take courses next semester.  The rule makes sense since I don’t know if I’m ready to take class like Artificial Intelligence before getting more experienced in coding. (that course sounds sooo damn interesting to me).

I don’t wanna do the half-time semester since I can’t think of any useful part-time job at this period of time. So probably some lower level electives instead. Very disappointed to know that I’m not eligible to take Mobile App Dev since I’m not in engineering school. Need to email and ask before giving up on it.

I remember someone told me senior students can graduate first with a few classes to take in the spring term after. Need to keep that in mind too. Anyway, I need a plan. Figuring out next semester’s schedule will be my first priority this weekend, together with rewriting one of my essays.

Need to sleep early.

Lastly, today is a good day. I must be grateful of what I have.
