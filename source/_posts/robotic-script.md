title: Robotic Script
---

This post isn’t  directly about WordPress, but I’m not ready to start a new category yet.  - -

I’ve been playing with Python during the weekend, as a WordPress user I encounters the problem of spamming now and then, gradually I become curious about how spams work. Before this I was looking into database injection which turned out to be too much ‘recreation’ for the weekend. Python seems a lot more friendly to me, since I used to code some python scripts to do my Structure class homework. Surprisingly, with the great power of Python’s handy libraries, especially “Mechanize”, I managed to make a basic spam script. And it’s only 14 lines, reminding me of Shakespeare’s sonnets which I learnt a little in a class I took two and a half years ago .

I won’t share the script this time. Unlike the backdoor script in my early post, which requires people to download, install and activate; this one can be quite harmful – anyone can target a blog’s comment page then start spamming immediately with this script. I’ll share something else here instead of the script – Shakespeare’s sonnet 18, it’s also 14 lines. ^ ^

###  Sonnet 18

<center>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?  
 Thou art more lovely and more temperate:  
 Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,  
 And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:  
 Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,  
 And often is his gold complexion dimm’d;  
 And every fair from fair sometime declines,  
 By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm’d;  
 But thy eternal summer shall not fade  
 Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;  
 Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,  
 When in eternal lines to time thou growest:  
 So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,  
 So long lives this and this gives life to thee.</center>  
 I remember my professor once said that the above sonnet is probably the most popular one among Shakespeare’s 154 sonnets, what do you think? I was a lot more interested in the plays rather than sonnets in that class. After I learnt how to spam, I realized there’s no actual use of it. I can’ t use it on any website since it’s both unethical and probably illegal. So I start trying to use the script to automatically update status in Weibo (Chinese twitter), Renren(Chinese FB) etc, because that seems kinda cool and useful, e.g. posting “HBD” to my friends’ wall at exactly 12 o’clock when it’s their birthday.  ^ ^

But soon I found it’s not that simple since “Mechanize” doesn’t support javascript and most of these websites either have verification code or javascript protection.

I didn't wanna give up easily, so I started exploring Selenium. ( To be continued…)
