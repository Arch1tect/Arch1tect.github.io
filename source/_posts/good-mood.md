This is a great weekend, because there’re many things to be cheerful for. Had some great chat with old friends: friends in Europe, friends in Canada, friends in California, friends in Illinois, friends back home and friends right here but haven’t seen for a while.

Anyway, things seem to be on the right track, and again, I’m filled with positive energy, which is really crucial. : )

Coming week will be extremely busy. Felt kinda shameful to come back from library at 3 AM tonight since there were still so many people studying for exam back there. Well, to work hard, I guess that’s a matter of life and death.

Last writing class is this Tuesday, it’s been a great class for me, very enjoyable. Thx to the super nice and experienced instructor. My last peer critic partner is a girl with unique qualities, I’m not sure how to describe that though. She dresses and behaves differently from everyone else in my eyes. There is a sense of classic? exotic? quality in her. Btw my writing class is mostly about music so many students in the class are from music school, with strong music background (e.g. play piano since four year old).

In short, they are musicians!

So is this girl. I found many videos of her performance on YouTube and she’s got a personal website with her own song tracks! (I’m such a stalker…)

Her website: [http://www.tannerporter.com/](http://www.tannerporter.com/)

I really enjoyed listening to her singing and it makes her even more special in my eyes now. Might because I don’t have many musician friends and I love exploring new fields. ：P

I was expecting her writing to be very deep or extremely elusive but I was so wrong. Her writing turns out to be quite easy to read. And she even put some simple drawings in it. That’s weird….I never knew u could do that for a paper = =||||   How are the drawing graded then. LOL just kidding.

Alright, very late now. Peace.
