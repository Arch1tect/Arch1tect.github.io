title: Google Drive vs Dropbox | iphone5 is out today!
---

Received an email from google drive team telling me that my 152 google doc files are waiting in google drive.

I heard about google’s cloud storage service quite a long time ago so I hit download and installed the program. It doesn’t disappoint me at all, moreover I was really happy to see my old files sync to my laptop automatically.(before this I can only open them through browser in google doc). And google drive starts with 5GB which is much bigger than dropbox’s 2GB. Now I have used dropbox for quite a while and invited many friends, the free space is still only 3.8GB. Then I further compare the price for getting more space from google and dropbox, you can see below:

As you can see that google’s price is only half of dropbox ( FYI: google charges $9.99 for 200GB ). As a student, both $2.49 and $4.99 plan look really attracting to me, and I might buy the first one and use for several months then buy the later when my drive is full. I must say the plan is much better designed than dropbox’s no bargain $9.99 plan. Moreover many other services including google docs is nicely connected to google drive. To conclude, I’m a little worried for dropbox if they still don’t take action.

BTW I know that cloud storage has been C2C for a while, what about google docs’ real-time collaborate feature? I just did a tiny search and there seems to be two small startups that have done that, but it doesn’t look like it’s popular in China yet. And I feel that’s something definitely worth startups developing or giant companies purchasing. Seeing it this way, GFW does help some native internet startups to survive in China, still,  in a potentially harmful way.

Today is also the day iphone5 comes out, I like it. Some say there’s very little improvement, and they get disappointed. To me it doesn’t really matter, my iphone 3GS is four years old already which can barely run any app, and I might buy this one simply because I like its number — 5. But I guess I’ll wait when it’s a little cheaper. I saw a school mate on renren says that his iphone4 is too old to use, and he’ll place an order for 5 right away. Am I the only one who feel bad about my abroad study expense?

Apparently not.
