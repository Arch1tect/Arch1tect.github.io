title: Almost there but will never get there
---

Towards the end of an incident which has been bothering me for months, I’ve been having complex emotions these days.

I don’t care too much about what the end is gonna be, just glad it will be over, finally.

I couldn’t sleep so I started playing the game I designed last weekend.

Simply wanna kill some time, and this game is decent for killing time.

It took me an hour, but I had to give up in the end, below is the best I got:

I just need to make the radius of the gravity field 1 cm smaller to win the game with the best record so far.

But my stars keep flying out once I reduce the radius just 0.2 cm.

Then I had to give up on this, it’s been an hour.

In the end, I lost the game.

 

My roomy said it’s a bug that you can’t reduce the amount of the stars once you add them to the game world.

True. A bug as it is.

And it’s not hard to fix.

But my thoughts change now.

The bug makes this game resembles life.

You always had to take the responsibility for choices you’ve made.

Face the consequence by yourself.

 

Life is a fair game.

“If I had added 5 stars less, I should have won the game half an hour ago, and still breaking previous records.”

In life that’s meaningless or even dangerous thought.

You need to avoid it.

There isn’t ‘if’ in real life.

 

What about the game then?

Does it need to be so harsh on its players?

Reminding them the cruelty of real world.

Or

Isn’t it fascinating for a game to resemble life?

That it reminds you that you can never undo things you did.

…

I’ll think about this again when improving the design of my game next time.

Now, peace.
