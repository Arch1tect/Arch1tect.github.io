**Interesting facts**  
 Area of interaction between blood and air is ~80m^2  
 The total amount of blood in the lungs at any time 1L = 20% of total blood.  
 The amount of blood in capillaries surrounding alveoli(肺泡) = 70ml.  
 Blood is in pulmonary capillaries for less than 1s.

From a simple mechanical point of view, the lung can be pictured as bag that is connected to an open tube and inside an expandable chamber.

**Surface Tension**

Water molecules have strong attractive Van-der-Waals interactions between each other, but little interactions with air or other non-polar materials. Creating a water-air surface costs energy. Surface tension: r(gama) = E/A

For water: 0.075 N/m

Pressure inside: P = 4r/R

**Surface Tension in Connected Alveoli**

The surface of a sphere scales as V2/3. Thus the surface energy of one large sphere is smaller than the surface energy of multiple small spheres of the same volume.  
 Why are the alveoli not merging?  
 Lung surfactants reduce the surface tension.  
 Surface tension increases when curvature(曲率: 1/radius) is very large.

**Pressure in an Artery Law of Laplace**  
 Tension in a cylindrical wall: T = P x r Tension in a spherical wall: T = ½ x P x r

• High pressure leads to an expansion of the  
 arterial wall.  
 • For small pressure increases, this is  
 accommodated by an increase in the  
 diameter of the blood vessel.  
 • Large pressure increases lead to aneurisms.  
 • The tension on the heart wall increases with  
 increasing pressure and volume.  
 • Hypertension can lead to congestive heart  
 failure.

Arterioles transport blood TO Capillaries from the HEART  
 Venules transport BLOOD AWAY FROM Capillaries and to the HEART

• In hydrostatics, the pressure in connected vessels is the same everywhere (Pascal’s Principle).  
 • In hydrodynamics, the pressure depends on the velocity. = > Bernoulli’s Principle

 

**Viscosity**

Force required to shear a fluid between a stationary and a moving plate:

**Blood as a Non-Newtonian Fluid**  
 • Blood is a complex fluid.  
 •The viscosity of blood decreases with increasing shear rate.  
 • At low shear rates, red blood cells can aggregate, and increase the viscosity.  
 • At high shear rates, red blood cells can be deformed, decreasing the viscosity。

**Laminar vs. Turbulent flow**

[![Screen Shot 2013-03-20 at 12.29.02 AM](/content/images/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-12.29.02-AM-300x77.png)](/content/images/uploads/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-12.29.02-AM.png)

 

• When viscosity dominates, the flow is laminar.  
 • When inertial effects dominate,the flow becomes turbulent.  
 • Ratio of inertia to viscosity: Reynolds number Re=ρvR/η  
 • For a cylindrical tube, crossover at Re≈2300.  
 • Turbulent flow has a larger flow resistance than laminar flow.

**Diffusion – probabilistic approach**  
**Gas Pressure**  
 Gas pressure is the result of the thermal motion of  
 the gas molecules.  
 • Given by the ideal gas law:  
 where R=Nk is the universal gas constant.  
 • For a mix of different non-interacting gases, the partial pressures of the individual gases add up:  
 P ⋅V = N ⋅R ⋅T  
 P_total= PA + PB  
**Solubility of Gases**  
 • Gases can be dissolved in liquids.  
 • Henry’s law:  
 where k is the Henry constant; which is different for each gas / liquid combination and a measure for the solubility.  
 • For gas mixtures, P refers to the partial  
 pressure of the gas of interest.  
 • In the lung, the partial pressure of O2 in the air is higher than in venal veal blood, thus O2  
 enters the bloodstream. Reverse for CO2.

**Osmosis**  
 • Osmosis requires a membrane that is permeable for only one species.  
 • All molecules of one species can be trapped in one side of the container, while the other species diffuses equally to both sides.  
 • Osmotic pressure: Π=c ⋅R ⋅T

**The Cell Membrane**

 Separates the cytoplasm from the extracellular fluid.  
 • Consists mainly of a lipid bilayer and embedded proteins.  
 • Keeps vital compounds inside the cell.  
 • Keeps detrimental substances out of the cell.

**The Lipid Bilayer**  
 The lipid bilayer consists primarily of a mix of  
 phospholipids.  
 • Generally fluid, but attached to some rigid structures.  
 • Polar (hydrophilic) on the outside.  
 • Non-polar (hydrophobic) on the inside.  
 • Approximately 3 nm thick.

**What gets through…and what doesn’t**  
 Small hydrophobic molecules:  
 O2, CO2, N2, benzene  
 Small uncharged polar molecules: H2O, ethanol, glycerol  
 Larger uncharged polar molecules: glucose, amino acids, nucleotides  
 Ions: H+, Na+, HCO3-, K+, Ca+, Mg2+, Cl-, etc.

**Other Transport Mechanisms**  
 DIFFUSION (small hydrophobic molecules only):  
 FACILITATED DIFFUSION, uniport (e.g. glucose transporters)  
 CO-TRANSPORT: symport(same direction) or antiport (opposite directions  
 CHANNELS, e.g. sodium channel, water channel (aquaporin)  
 ACTIVE TRANSPORTER, against potential energy gradient
