title: On My Way to Encore
---

On my way to [Encore Records](http://encorerecords.tumblr.com/) I came across my old friends Jason, Dan and Melissa from architecture school. They have not changed at all. And it feels like the old days when we talk, which isn’t that strange since it’s only been six months (felt longer might due to that I haven’t been doing anything related to arch in the past six months). We chatted for a while, they told me about life in Grad school. It doesn’t sound much different from the undergrad. And that’s a big reason I’m reluctant to go to grad school for architecture, at least not right away. Not to mention that architecture may not be in my future plan any more.

“To take a few years off” before grad school seems quite common here in the U.S. and I think it can be necessary for some. Grad school is all about concentration which certainly requires people’s commitment. And we need time and experience to make that commitment, it’s a life-long commitment thus can’t and shouldn’t be rushed. However, many times we may feel we are behind because our friends at the same age are already working or married or even have children. But to me that almost sounds like a competition, which I am totally against. And even if life is a competition it should be ourselves that we are competing with, not our classmates from high school, not the guy on TV or the other guy we found on a page of a random magazine. It’s not comparable however similar your backgrounds are, since every one is unique, with different passions and different dreams.

And I think If people are following the trend, they may want to make sure if that’s really what they want or if that’s just what the society want from them. Otherwise they might not be really happy about what they are doing. Though they are “suppose” to be happy. ( If you happen to read this, please take it as a kind reminder, absolutely no offense. It’s just my perspective right now and I could be wrong, and I never judge people.)

Before we depart, Jason gave me a ride to central campus, and he’s talkative as before. We met in the summer two years ago when I made friends with many other American transfer students who turned out to be my best friends in the following two years. After that summer term, it became a lot harder to make such close friends here. The reason is complex and I’m not going to dive into that here.

Transfer students usually have richer life experiences and some of them are elder than others. For example, Jason had ten years work experience before coming here and Dan was in the US Navy for nine years. AJ had been working too and he never stopped working during our extremely busy arch study, which was incredible to me. They helped me a lot in those years, so did Simon, Carlos, Josh, Ryan, Gordon, Marie, Chong etc. They showed me some new perspectives of life that I wasn’t exposed to. I don’t have any clue where they are now, but luckily, there’s Facebook, and I can always find them back and say hi when I’m ready. Hope they are all doing well right now. Best wishes.

Very few Chinese study architecture in undergrad, though there are so many Chinese students in this university. Since I’m lazy to reach out, I don’t go to the group I “should” go to but stay in the studio every day. My mom on the other side of QQ wasn’t happy about this and had told me time after time to build up my connections.

Me and George are the only two Chinese in that summer, the rest are almost all natives. So I propose we speak English even between us to improve our oral English asap. He agreed. Then I didn’t speak a Chinese word for those two months. Sabrina from Taiwan was quite surprise to know that when she arrived in the fall. (She must thought we were weird since I think the same now) and when north campus was filled with Chinese as fall semester started, we found it awkward to continue speaking English between us too. – -

P.S.
Encore Records is an old CD store. I visited there for my English Creative Writing class.
