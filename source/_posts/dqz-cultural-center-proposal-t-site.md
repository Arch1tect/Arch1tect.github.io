title: DQZ Cultural Center Proposal & T-Site
---

Came across two interesting projects this morning on ArchDaily.

 


##### [DQZ Cultural Center Proposal / Holm Architecture Office (HAO) + AI](http://www.archdaily.com/286671/dqz-cultural-center-proposal-holm-architecture-office-hao-ai/?utm_source=ArchDaily+List&utm_campaign=a05cde5e83-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email)

 


##### [T-Site / Klein Dytham Architecture](http://www.archdaily.com/290729/t-site-klein-dytham-architecture/)


 


You will see someone familier in the renderings of the first one if you are a Chinese. (There must be a Chinese in [Holm Architecture Office (HAO)](http://www.holmarchitectureoffice.com/), since I can always find that “someone” in their renderings.)

For T-Site I like the atmosphere architecture creates. And their facade design is both visually appealing and functional. In short, typical Japanese architecture, simple but full of flavor.
