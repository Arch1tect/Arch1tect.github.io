title: Processing Workshop (Day 1)
---

Today’s workshop is pretty cool, we learnt how to make something like an elastic spider web. I wish I could post it here, but after spending a long time trying to port it into Javascript or applet, it turned out neither worked for me. The thing we build looks like this example [here](http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/20140 "curtain") but not that good (requires Java).

I also like this one on that website, check it out:    **[IK explosions](http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/8351)**

 

This one below is in Javascript by Joao Martinho Moura, an Interactive Media Artist and Researcher.

Fancy, isn’t it? And it gives me an impression that resembles architectural drawing, maybe it’s the puristic black and white or maybe the depth and space created by the lines intersecting and overlapping each other. Anyway, it’s just beautiful in an elegant  way to me.

And you can use your mouse to manipulate it too!

Alright, that’s today. Looking forward to tmr’s workshop, so tired right now… peace.
