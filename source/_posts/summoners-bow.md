title: Summoner's Bow
---
*Summoner's Bow* is a game I started building this summer with the same tools/libraries as my last game - Cannon2D. In this game player can both shoot arrows and summon helpers to beat the enemy. Although I finished the coding part, the graphics part is very time-consuming for me. The current version of this game contains some graphics from Internet as placeholders, so I haven't published it to any public app market yet.

This should be my last side project before I graduate, special thanks to TY and Luna for their awesome advice!
