title: Squattable Artwork & Squares
---

Empty space keeps a city flexible but too much empty space becomes an issue. This project is about activating empty squares in Rotterdam by placing a series of public artworks. Taking the idea from squatting, the artwork is designed completely open-ended for anyone with different purposes. Meanwhile the activated squares will attract people to occupy nearby buildings so that the vacancy problem of the area can also be alleviated.  
 Three specific designs are presented below. Schouwburgplein plaza is located in the heart of a commercial district but there isn’t any activity on the square most of the time. The idea of this half demolished cubic house is inspired by the crane sculpture on the square also associated with the demolish-and-construct life cycle during the development of Rotterdam.

Station Blaak has vast open space and there is a lively market every Tuesday and Saturday. But for the rest of the time, it’s empty. A proposed linear and continuous design is added to the square that well copes with the market while providing alternate functions.

The third sculpture is a fantasy-like proposal for Moerkeke Square. In all, these squattable artworks are experimental and modular. They can be moved or transformed easily when their mission is completed or when they no longer suit the square.
