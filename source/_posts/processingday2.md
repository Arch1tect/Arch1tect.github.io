title: Processing Workshop (Day 2)
---

Two days’ workshop is over. It’s pretty good in general.  
 The project below was made using Processing in my spare time.  
 It doesn’t has much to do with what we learn from the workshop and is quite random.

This project has two different modes: game mode and view mode.

**<span style="color: #ff6600;">Game Mode:</span>**

I wasn’t planning to make a game at the beginning, only got the idea after tracing the city skyline.  
 So the logic of this game might be illusive.  - -|||

But  I’ll try to explain a little bit:

Basically you want to protect the “city” from being attacked by the crazy flickering line above.  
 You can regard the line as lightening or alien or anything that may destroy the city.

Once the line “hit” the city, the “health” of the city drops. And when it’s zero, you lose.

You can protect the city by keeping the line away and stabilizing the city.

**<span style="color: #ff6600;">Viw Mode:</span>**

There is no score counting in this mode, but you have more keyboard controls (only works in View Mode):

a = zoom in  
 z = zoom out  
 p = pause/continue  
 f =  follow

You can press ‘ r ‘ to restart in both modes.

Ok, enough explanation. Try the game and have fun!

<div></div>The skyline belongs to a city in China, guess which one it is?

诸位能看出来这是哪个城市的天际线么？
