title: New Semester

First day of new semester today. Already quite exhausted, yet excited!

I’m taking maximum credits this time (18), with no simple courses at all. (Alright, there might be one - *physics and music*, I don’t know yet.)

Data structure and algorithm is famous for its difficulty. Burning night oil seems inevitable. Anyway I’ll do my best!

Recently I’m helping Louise changing the appearance of StarryStory.org, I think the [new look](http://starrystory.org/temp/) is much better : )

Before that I added a back end for my SquidGirl robot, so people can pretend they are robot and deliver their words through the mouth of SquidGirl. I think the project has great potential and I shall further develop it when I’m free again.

However, I guess I won’t have much spare time to develop any extra-curriculum project this semester, (seriously? you think you still have spare time? = =)

I had this idea about working in interdisciplinary fields that need both architecture and computer science skills. But all I can think of for that are Google Sketchup, Rhino, AutoCad etc… Google Sketchup is definitely the most interesting one to me since it has to do with Google Earth and Google Map. I’ll keep that in mind when looking for intern or job.

What I also need to keep in mind is, besides being a key to the future, this learning process should be exhaustive yet enjoyable, since life isn’t all about destination.

And enjoyable it will be. I have faith in it.
