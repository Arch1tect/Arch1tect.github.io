This is actually the first post after I decided to use swotong.com as my domain name. It really took me a while to collect my previous posts from different sources here but it definitely worth it. What can be a better way of recording one’s life than blogging? And sometimes I ask myself did things really happen or does it matter anymore if it’s neither in anyone’s memory nor recorded by some kind of media. And that question kind of push me to being a nihilist, especially when I keep zooming out… Alright, I should stop it before it goes too far and my first post should be a little bit more positive than that : )

Discrete maths and English writing should be my two focus this semester. They are both important and seemingly useful according to my observation so far. The later is quite challenging for an International student as me though, more hard work required. But on the other side challenge should be exciting and fun, hopefully.

In order to better get involved in the discussion section for the writing class, I’ll try to write a concise thought after reading every time before class. Not only because participating in the discussion counts for credit but also that communication is a quite an important skill.

Lastly I’m still being troubled by the waiting list issue. Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
