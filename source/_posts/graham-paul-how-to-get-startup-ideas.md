title: Graham, Paul. "How to Get Startup Ideas"
---

[http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)

Notes:

1. “The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It’s to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.”

2. “You can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter.”

(The needs that a large amount of people want large amount are usually tried many times or accomplished already)

3. “Made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type. Lots of people are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners.”

(Interesting, almost tried this one this summer)

4. “When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they’ll use it even when it’s a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they’ve never heard of? If you can’t answer that, the idea is probably bad.”

5. ”

> Live in the future, then build what’s missing.

That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started. Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the world.

”

6. “If you’re not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you can get to one. For example, anyone reasonably smart can probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps) in a year. Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5 years of your life, a year’s preparation would be a reasonable investment. Especially if you’re also looking for a cofounder. <span style="color: #999999;">[[<span style="color: #999999;">4</span>](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html#f4n)]</span>

You don’t have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a domain that’s changing fast. Other domains change fast. But while learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable future sufficient. As Marc Andreessen put it, software is eating the world, and this trend has decades left to run.

Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you’ll be able to implement them. That’s not absolutely necessary (Jeff Bezos couldn’t) but it’s an advantage. It’s a big advantage, when you’re considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking “That’s an interesting idea,” you can think instead “That’s an interesting idea. I’ll try building an initial version tonight.” It’s even better when you’re both a programmer and the target user, because then the cycle of generating new versions and testing them on users can happen inside one head.”

(An advantage it is in doing startup. Meanwhile being able to carry out an idea brings great pleasure to me, but it’s time-consuming and can be bad to my health.)
