title: Squid Girl | Box2dweb

Caught a bad cold yesterday, I decide to stay in bed all day today. > <

While browsing my previous posts, I found my interest in Box2dweb again. Since it’s in pure javascript and HTML5, it’s quite flexible and friendly to devices that support browser. And that is one of the reasons I love it. Reading my study notes, gradually I remember that I used to have so many ideas about utilizing Box2dweb, eg. to combine it with Wordpress (put it into a theme or combine with the weichuncai plugin), to combine it with SNS, to make a real-time multi-player game with websocket etc. I was so excited about those ideas at that time.

But I then switch my interest to building social network using Wordpress mu etc., and haven’t looked into box2dweb for a while. I should definitely design and code a tiny game with box2dweb in the near future. For this post, I’ll just revise one of my old project to recall my happy memories with Box2dweb. ^ ^

Click on the canvas then use W A S D to control direction; J, K to drift; T to teleport and R to restart. Also, try some number keys and you’ll meet some other characters. ^ ^
